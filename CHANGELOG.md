# Changelog

All notable changes to this skill are documented here.

## [1.3.2] — 2026-06-27

### Changed (cleanup — review follow-up)
- **`TicketPanel.publishChannel` / `openCategory` / `closedCategory` are now optional.** These are Discord-specific concepts (a guild channel/category structure) that the WhatsApp 1:1 intake had to fake placeholder values for (`publishChannel: 'whatsapp'`, `openCategory: ''`) just to satisfy the shared type. `resolveCategories()` now returns `{ open?: string; closed?: string }`, and the Discord wiring (`findCategoryId`, `!ticket-setup`'s panel lookup) handles the `undefined` case explicitly instead of assuming every panel has these fields. The WhatsApp panel now omits them entirely rather than shoehorning in dead values. No behavior change for Discord (its panel always supplies real values). 1 new regression test (262 total); typecheck and smoke clean.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-06-27

### Fixed (bug hunt — multi-angle review of everything since the last security pass)
- **Critical: duplicate WhatsApp tickets after a close.** `InMemoryTicketStore.byChannel` returned the *first-inserted* ticket for a channel id, not the live one. WhatsApp reuses a member's `wa_id` as the channel id across the lifetime of the contact, so once their first ticket closed, every subsequent message found the stale closed ticket via `byChannel`, opened a new one, and the next message repeated the cycle — unbounded duplicate tickets per returning contact, `maxOpenPerUser` never effectively capping anything. Fixed at the data layer (`byChannel` now prefers a live open/claimed ticket, falling back to the most recent) **and** in `whatsapp/bot.ts` (a closed ticket is now `reopen()`-ed instead of a new one being created, so a wa_id never accumulates more than one ticket record). Verified end-to-end against a live server: 1 ticket after open → close → 4 more inbound messages.
- **High: a single aborted/malformed webhook request could crash the whole process.** The webhook handler had no error boundary — `readRawBody`'s promise rejecting (e.g. a client dropping the connection mid-upload) became an unhandled promise rejection, which terminates a Node process by default. The request handler is now wrapped so any thrown/rejected error is caught and turned into a clean response (or a closed connection) instead of taking down the server. Verified live: the server stays up and keeps answering requests after a simulated connection abort.
- **High: unbounded webhook body size (memory-exhaustion DoS).** `readRawBody` buffered the entire request body with no cap, and signature verification only ran after the full body was read — so the memory cost was paid even for a request that would be rejected anyway. Added a 1MB cap (generous for Cloud API JSON payloads) that destroys the connection past the limit, plus `server.requestTimeout`/`server.headersTimeout` (a raw `node:http` server has no framework-level limits the way grammY/discord.js do for the other bots). Verified live: an oversized POST is rejected and the server stays responsive.
- **Medium: `mass-ping` matcher cache could return the wrong regex for a different token list.** The cache key was `tokens.join('|')` — the same delimiter used to build the regex alternation — so a token containing a literal `|` could collide with an unrelated token list that happened to join to the same string (realistic since `moderate_message` is an MCP tool taking caller-supplied `massPingTokens` per call). Switched the cache key to `JSON.stringify(list)` (collision-free) and capped the cache size (it was also unbounded, a slow leak under varying per-call token lists).
- **Medium: WhatsApp scam-checks always scored as a brand-new account.** `accountAgeDays` was hardcoded to `0` for every WhatsApp `moderateMessage` call, unconditionally tripping the `fresh-account-link` signal even for members who'd been messaging the support number for months. Now computed from the member record's actual `joinedAt`, matching the Telegram/Discord bots' pattern.
- **Medium: `looksLikeScamCheck` missed the link shapes scammers actually use.** It used a naive `/https?:\/\//` regex, so a forwarded `t.me/...`, `discord.gg/...`, or bare `www.`-prefixed link never triggered the scam-check path. Now reuses `scanUrls`' own extraction (already a dependency a line below it) instead of a second, weaker, hand-rolled detector.
- **Low: attacker-controlled WhatsApp text could forge log lines.** The inbound contact name and message text flowed unsanitized into `console.log` (via the routing handoff). Control characters (newlines, ANSI escapes) are now stripped once, at the top of `handleInbound`, before the text is used anywhere downstream.
- **Low: `apply_content_filters` MCP tool silently no-op'd on a misspelled filter name.** `present` was `z.array(z.string())` with no validation against the real 27-filter catalog; now `z.array(z.enum(CONTENT_FILTERS))`, so a typo is a clear schema-validation error instead of a silently-ignored filter.

5 new regression tests (261 total — `tests/ticketing.test.ts` `byChannel` liveness, `tests/core.test.ts` cache-collision, `tests/whatsapp-intake.test.ts` scheme-less link detection); typecheck and smoke clean. Found via an 8-angle review (line-by-line, removed-behavior, cross-file trace, reuse/simplification/efficiency, altitude/conventions) covering everything since the prior security pass, with extra scrutiny on the WhatsApp webhook as the repo's first internet-facing transport.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-27

### Added
- **WhatsApp support intake — compliant 1:1 channel, NOT group moderation.** WhatsApp has no API, official or otherwise, to read or moderate a group chat — so this adds a member-initiated DM channel on the official WhatsApp Business Cloud API instead, reusing the existing core rather than forking it:
  - `examples/whatsapp-intake.ts` (pure, tested): parses the Cloud API webhook payload (`parseCloudApiWebhook`, ignoring non-text/status events without throwing), decides scam-check vs. support-ticket intent (`looksLikeScamCheck`), renders the advisory scam-check reply and the ticket-ack reply, and verifies the webhook's `X-Hub-Signature-256` HMAC (constant-time compare).
  - `examples/whatsapp/bot.ts`: a dependency-free Node `http` webhook server (handshake + signature-gated receive) that calls the **same** `moderateMessage`/`scanUrls` (advisory scam-check, no action taken — there's no group to act in) or the **same** `ticketing.ts`/`classify-and-route.ts`/`member-store.ts`/`event-log.ts` core the Discord/Telegram bots use (support path), with the WhatsApp conversation's `wa_id` standing in for a "channel."
  - `MemberRecord.platform` widened to include `'whatsapp'`; a WhatsApp contact shares the same roster/analytics as Telegram/Discord members (joins/leaves stay 0 for this platform — there's no group to join).
  - Config in `templates/foka-config.json` → `whatsapp` (non-secret only; token/verify-token/app-secret are env-only). Full compliant-scope writeup, setup steps, and security notes: `resources/whatsapp-intake.md`.
  - `engines.node` bumped to `>=18` (the adapter uses global `fetch` to call the Graph API). 16 new tests; smoke +6 checks.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-27

### Added
- **3 new MCP tools** expose the community-ops layer so Claude/Cursor (or any MCP client) can call it directly: `apply_content_filters` (content-type filter decision), `check_immunity` (MEE6 immunity check), and `build_analytics` (group analytics + day×hour heatmap from an event log). `moderate_message` also gained the `massPingTokens` arg. The MCP server now exposes **6 tools** (was 3).
- **README** Features entry covering the Combot/MEE6-parity community ops + the channel-wide ping guard.

### Changed
- **Quickstart** rewritten for the plugin layout — correct paths, the new config blocks (`contentFilters`/`immunity`/`auditLog`/`analytics`/`ticketing`/`massPingTokens`), and an admin command table (`/stats`, `/members`, `/immunity`, `/help`, `!ticket-setup`).

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-27

### Changed
- **Channel-wide ping tokens are now configurable.** `foka-config.json` → `moderation.massPingTokens` (passed to the scorer as `input.massPingTokens`) lets a community add/remove the `@`-tokens that trip the `mass-ping` signal, with the built-in list as the default. Tokens are matched as **escaped literals** joined into one alternation — never user-supplied regex, so it stays ReDoS-safe — and an empty list disables the check. Wired into both reference bots (`MASS_PING_TOKENS`). 3 tests added (custom list, disable, metacharacter escaping).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-27

### Added
- **Channel-wide ping protection (`@everyone` / `@here` / `@all`).** A non-admin who posts `@everyone`, `@here`, `@all` (also `@channel`/`@room`/`@online`/`@group`/`@todos`) now trips a `mass-ping` signal in the scorer → the message is removed (and combined with links/scam it climbs to mute + escalate). Previously only **≥5** individual `@`-mentions tripped the mass-mention signal, so a lone `@everyone` — which pings the whole server — slipped through scoring `0`. Detected on raw text at a real mention position, so `name@everyone.com` and `@allan` are **not** flagged; admins are exempt at the bot layer (immune / `TRUSTED` are escalated, not auto-actioned). 6 regression tests added (`examples/moderate-message.ts`).

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-27

### Security (post-restructure bug hunt)
- **Discord mention injection (@everyone cannon) fixed.** The bot echoes member-controlled text — welcome names and audit-log nicknames — to channels. A new member or nickname set to `@everyone`/`@here` could make the bot mass-ping the server (welcome via `systemChannel.send`) or the log channel (audit sink via `channel.send`), since neither suppressed mentions. Fixed at the right altitude: the Discord `Client` now defaults to `allowedMentions: { parse: [] }`, so no echoed mention from any bot message can notify — mentions still render, they just don't ping. Defense-in-depth: `examples/welcome.ts` `safeName()` now breaks `@`/`#` mention triggers with a zero-width space (covers Telegram `@username` too). Regression test added.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-27

### Changed (repackaged as a Claude Code plugin)
- Restructured the repo into a distributable **Claude Code plugin**: added `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (installable via `/plugin marketplace add`), moved the skill under `skills/community-moderation/` (SKILL.md + examples/resources/templates/docs/tests/rules, self-contained), and kept `agents/` + `commands/` as plugin components at the root.
- Replaced `install.sh` with a Node installer `bin/install.js` (ESM, dependency-free) exposed as the `community-moderation-skill` bin, so `npx community-moderation-skill` vendors the plugin into `./.claude`.
- Updated build config (`tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`), `package.json` (bin/files/engines/repository + version 1.0.0), and all cross-file references (README, CLAUDE.md, the agent and command) to the new paths. No source logic changed — 230 tests / typecheck / smoke still green.

## [0.6.1] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed (review hardening pass)
- **Ticketing: orphaned-ticket lockout.** A ticket was persisted (counting toward `maxOpenPerUser`) before its Discord channel was created; a failed `channels.create` left the user permanently unable to open a ticket. Now the channel is created inside a `try`, and on failure the ticket is rolled back via the new `TicketStore.remove()`.
- **Ticketing: interaction-ack timeouts.** `handleOpen` now `deferReply()`s before the (slow) channel creation, and `/ticket-delete` acknowledges before building the transcript — both previously risked exceeding Discord's 3 s interaction window, leaving the command "failed" (and, for delete, the channel undeleted).
- **Ticketing: open race.** Rapid double-clicks could bypass `maxOpenPerUser`; `registerTicketing` now reserves an in-flight key synchronously per opener.
- **Discord admin replies: markdown/mention injection.** `!stats` / `!members` / `!immunity` / `!help` wrapped attacker-controlled display names in a code block without escaping backticks, allowing fence breakout (and `@everyone`). Output now neutralizes backticks and sends with `allowedMentions: { parse: [] }`.
- **CSV export: formula injection (CWE-1236).** `toCSV` now prefixes any cell starting with `= + - @ \t \r` with `'`, so a member-controlled name like `=HYPERLINK(...)` can't execute when the roster is opened in Excel/Sheets; the Username column is exported as the bare handle.
- **Audit log: silent drop on cache miss.** The Discord audit sink now falls back to `channels.fetch()` when the log channel isn't cached.
- **Content filters: NEW-member override gap.** `newMemberNoLinks` / `newMemberNoMedia` now upgrade any action weaker than `delete` (not only `allow`), so a configured `warn` no longer lets a brand-new member's link/media survive.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Ticketing (MEE6 "Ticketing" parity, Discord).** A transport-agnostic ticket lifecycle core (`examples/ticketing.ts`): panels (publish channel, manager roles, panel embed, button types with per-button categories, intro message, transcript config, `maxOpenPerUser`), a ticket state machine (`open → claimed → closed → reopened → deleted`) with pure `claim`/`close`/`reopen`/`deleteTicket` transitions that fail cleanly on invalid moves, per-panel sequence numbers, a `TicketStore` (+ `InMemoryTicketStore`), manager-role permission checks, command toggles (MEE6 defaults: claim off, close/delete/reopen on), and renderers (`renderIntro`, `ticketChannelName`, `renderTranscript`). discord.js wiring (`examples/discord/ticketing.ts`): a panel button opens a private channel scoped to the opener + manager roles under the configured category, `/ticket-claim|close|reopen|delete` run only inside a ticket channel by a manager, and a transcript is delivered to the transcript channel and/or the opener's DM on close/delete. Reference bot publishes a panel + registers the slash commands via a new `!ticket-setup` admin command (`GuildModeration` intent already added). Config in `templates/foka-config.json` → `ticketing`; spec in `resources/ticketing.md`; covered by `tests/ticketing.test.ts` (16 cases) and the smoke self-test. Transcripts are the one place message content is materialized — by design, kept to the transcript channel and subject to retention.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Audit logging (MEE6 "Audit Logging" parity).** `examples/audit-log.ts` routes 24 server-event types across 7 categories (moderation / message / member / role / voice / server / channel) to a logging channel. `shouldLog()` gates on `enabled` → bot-actor filter → ignored channels (message events) → per-event toggle; `formatAuditEntry()` renders a one-line entry; `AuditLogger` dispatches through an **injected sink** (transport stays out of the core, gating/formatting fully testable). Privacy-preserving: logs metadata only — who/what/where/when — **never deleted/edited message content** (unlike MEE6), honoring `privacy.storeRawMessages`. Wired into both bots (channel id from `LOG_CHANNEL` env): `message_deleted` (auto-mod), `member_muted` (auto-mute + impersonation), `member_joined`/`member_left` on both; plus `member_banned` (`GuildBanAdd`) and `nickname_changed`/`member_roles_changed` (`GuildMemberUpdate`) on Discord. Config in `templates/foka-config.json` → `auditLog` (every event toggle + `ignoredChannels`, `dontLogBots`, `dontDisplayThumbnails`); catalog in `resources/audit-log.md`; covered by `tests/audit-log.test.ts` and the smoke self-test.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Immunity roles (MEE6 "Immunity Roles" parity).** `examples/immunity.ts` (`isImmune`) exempts a subject from **both** auto-moderation and escalation. Server owner, Administrator-permission roles, listed bot masters, and bots are immune by default (each toggleable); additional immune roles are configured by name or id (normalized: leading `@` stripped, case-insensitive). Wired into both reference bots — Discord maps directly to server roles + `Administrator` + guild owner; Telegram maps chat creator/administrators to owner/admin and matches an admin's `custom_title`, resolving admin status lazily (only when an action would fire, so no extra `getChatMember` call per message). Stronger than `TRUSTED` (which still escalates). Config in `templates/foka-config.json` → `immunity`; policy in `resources/moderation-policy.md` (§ Immunity); injection note in `resources/security.md`; covered by `tests/immunity.test.ts` and the smoke self-test. Immunity is **config-only** — never grantable via chat.
- **`/immunity` · `!immunity` admin command.** Prints the immunity policy (defaults + immune roles) and who's currently immune (Telegram: chat admins; Discord: each immune role's live member count), or checks a single user when used as a reply (Telegram) or with a mention (Discord), returning `✅ immune — <reason>` / `❌ not immune`. Renderers `explainImmunity()` / `formatImmunityPolicy()` added to `examples/immunity.ts`.
- **`/help` · `!help` admin command.** Lists the available admin commands with argument hints and a platform-specific tip, from a single source of truth (`examples/commands-help.ts`, `renderHelp(prefix)`) shared by both bots. Covered by `tests/commands-help.test.ts` and the smoke self-test.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Group analytics (Combot "Analytics" parity).** `examples/analytics.ts` turns a `join | leave | message` event log into a period report — joined, left, net growth, messages, active users, average DAU and daily messages, last-joined / last-left lists, and a 7×24 day-of-week × hour activity heatmap — each compared to the immediately preceding equal-length window with Combot-style % change. Includes `formatReport()` and `renderHeatmap()` so an agent can post a `/stats` reply or weekly digest as plain text, and `heatmapPeak()` for the busiest slot. Timezone-aware bucketing via `analytics.tzOffsetMinutes` (no `Intl` dependency, fully deterministic). Privacy-preserving: reads only event type + member id + timestamp, never message content. Config in `templates/foka-config.json` → `analytics`; spec in `resources/analytics.md`; covered by `tests/analytics.test.ts` and the smoke self-test.
- **Member directory (Combot "Users" parity, without XP).** `examples/member-directory.ts` joins member records with per-member message aggregates into a sortable/filterable/paginated roster — ID, Name, Username, MSG (period), AD active-days (`x/N`), Warns, MSG(all), Last msg, Joined, Left, Lang, and **Trust state (replaces XP)** — with Current/All/Left tab counts, `toCSV()` export, and `renderTable()` for chat. Backed by a new append-only `examples/event-log.ts` (`InMemoryEventLog`, retention + hard cap, counts only). `MemberRecord` gains `displayName` and `leftAt`; `MemberStore` gains `all()`, `recordMessage()`, `markLeft()`. Config in `templates/foka-config.json` → `directory`; spec in `resources/member-directory.md`; covered by `tests/member-directory.test.ts` + `tests/event-log.test.ts`.
- **Bots wired for observability.** Both reference bots now record `join`/`leave`/`message` events (kept messages only — removed spam never inflates counts) and expose admin-only commands: **`/stats`** + **`/members [current|all|left]`** on Telegram (gated via `getChatMember`), **`!stats`** + **`!members …`** on Discord (gated via `ManageGuild`). New-member joins capture `displayName`; leaves mark `leftAt`; rejoins clear it.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Content-type filters (Combot "Filters" parity).** All 27 Telegram content filters — links, words, RTL chars, commands, games, voice/video/audio, files, channel posts, animated dice, mentions, inline-bot messages, stickers, GIFs, external quotes, stories, images, custom emojis, edited messages, videos, service messages, contacts, forwards, duplicate text, guest mode, message length — encoded as a deterministic filter layer that runs **before** the scam scorer. Config in `templates/foka-config.json` → `contentFilters` (each filter → `allow | warn | delete | mute | kick | ban | off`, strictest action wins); logic in `examples/content-filters.ts` (`detectTelegramFeatures()` → `applyContentFilters()`); full catalog + Telegram-signal mapping in `resources/content-filters.md`. Trust-aware: `NEW`/`FLAGGED` members are auto-restricted by `trust.newMemberNoLinks` / `newMemberNoMedia` even when a filter is set to `allow`. Covered by `tests/content-filters.test.ts` and the smoke self-test.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-25

Initial release for the Superteam BR Solana AI Kit skills bounty.

### Added
- Evasion-resistant normalization (homoglyph / zero-width / leet / accent folding) and URL defense (punycode, raw-IP, deep-subdomain, brand-impersonation, blocklist, shortener-unshorten hook); a configurable link **whitelist** (`officialDomains`) whose links are fully exempt — never flagged or penalized, even from new members.
- Multilingual scam lexicon and support taxonomy in **10 languages** (EN/PT/ES/ID/VI/TR/RU/ZH/KO/JA), with script-aware normalization (Cyrillic/Greek folded only in mixed-script tokens so genuine Russian/Greek is preserved; Hangul/kana survive an NFKD→NFC round-trip).
- Optional `confusables-pro` module — full Unicode (TR39) homoglyph coverage via the `confusables` lib, injected behind the same mixed-script gating so the detection core stays dependency-free.
- Deterministic moderation scorer with a member trust-state machine, signal→action matrix, escalation ladder, and raid protocol.
- Support triage (11 tags, P1–P4 SLAs) and persona/channel routing.
- Injection-safe gray-zone LLM adjudicator (injected judge; content passed as data).
- Cross-skill composition (`birdeye`/`helius`/`wallet-analysis`) for on-chain honeypot signals.
- Deploy utilities: `MemberStore`, token-bucket `RateLimiter`, `IdempotencyStore`.
- Contact management: member contact records with a trust lifecycle (`maybePromote`, `vouch`), reputation (`adjustReputation`), relationship tags + lookup (`addTag`/`findByTag`/`findByRole`), and per-contact history (interactions, linked tickets, notes). See `resources/contact-management.md`.
- Reference Telegram (grammY) and Discord (discord.js) bots and an MCP server.
- Security model (prompt-injection, ReDoS, abuse/brigading, privacy, secrets), regression corpus, and CI.

### Added (defense)
- Admin-impersonation defense (`examples/impersonation.ts`): compares each sender's display name / handle against a protected-admin roster on the normalized skeleton (so homoglyph/zero-width look-alike handles are caught). Impersonators are muted (can't message) and escalated; real admins are exempt. Wired into both reference bots; roster in `foka-config.json` → `impersonation.protectedAdmins`.
- Configurable welcome message for new members (`examples/welcome.ts`): placeholder template (`{name}` / `{community}` / `{rules}`) that reinforces the anti-scam golden rules; the joiner's name is sanitized (URLs stripped) so a scammer can't get a link echoed by the bot. Wired into both bots' join events; config in `foka-config.json` → `welcome`.

### Security
- Audited for bugs/vulnerabilities: per-chat idempotency keys (Telegram), scam deletion no longer gated by the self rate-limiter (raid-safe), timed mutes (`until_date`), clock-skew guard, input length cap (anti-DoS), and validated LLM output. Precision pass: word-prefix matching for ASCII classifier keywords (kills mid-word false positives like "api" in "capital", "sign" in "design"), dropped an over-generic VI term, and full Greek+Cyrillic homoglyph coverage via membership check. Trusted members (mods/vouched) are escalated, not auto-deleted/muted (a mod's scam warning contains scam keywords); input is length-capped before URL/mention scanning, not only normalization. Bare (schemeless) homoglyph domains are now extracted via a Unicode-aware matcher and folded for lookalike detection, with an expanded Cyrillic + Greek confusables map (ѕ/і/ј/ԁ/ӏ/ԛ/ԝ/һ + β/γ/η/χ/ω/ϲ/ϱ).
